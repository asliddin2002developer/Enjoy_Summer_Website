The Camp Enjoy Summer experience is comprised of a wealth of activities and specialty programming. Designed to cater to the interests of each individual camper, our array of options satisfies those who envision themselves either playing sports, paintballing, canoeing, woodworking, or enjoying any of our other varied activities. Our extensive program, experienced on our expansive grounds, provides Nageela campers with the opportunity to develop their skills while experiencing the summer of a lifetime!

Known for their enthusiasm and idealistic spirit, Enjoy Summer staff members are selected for their ability to create a warm and nourishing environment. Our 3:1 camper-to-staff ratio ensures caring, individualized attention and rich relationships that embrace and encourage the campers to grow. Counselors at Nageela are full of life and haven’t forgotten what it’s like to be a camper!

TeeNageela, our fast-paced teen program for campers completing grades 8 & 9, provides the best of Camp Nageela, plus a special twist designed for teenagers. Teens experience accelerated fun while taking part in leadership training opportunities. Campers completing 10th grade enjoy all the great activities of TeeNageela while also taking the position of “Junior Staff”. They fill positions such as waiter/waitress or staff assistant and receive special privileges.

At Enjoy Summer we strive to ensure healthy living through appropriate rest time, fluid intake and sunscreen protection stations. Well-balanced, nourishing and delicious Kosher meals and snacks are prepared daily. We are delighted to meet any special dietary needs your child may have. Campers and staff enjoy air-conditioned hotel-like accommodations and clean, spacious facilities. Our fully equipped infirmary is staffed with trained medical personnel, and our “Camp Mom” is available around the clock for camper care & “away from home mothering”.

Each summer, over 200 campers have the opportunity to engage their Jewish heritage and culture through exciting and meaningful informal discussion groups. In addition, we are happy to assist your child in preparing for his/her Bar/Bat Mitzvah.

Thanks to Nageela’s benefactors, we are able to offer an unforgettable summer at an unbeatable price. As you explore our website, we are sure you will discover that Enjoy Summer is the place for your child this summer. If you would like additional information, please call 516-374-1528.

Thank you for visiting our website. We look forward to welcoming you to the Enjoy Summer Family for what we know will be the “Highlight of your year and the experience of a lifetime!“</p>

              <h1>Our Mission</h1>
              <p class="lead">The Enjoy Summer Mission

To impart to children core muslim values of social and personal responsibility, thirst for knowledge, and living purposefully. Camp staff model these values through joyful experiences, igniting in participants the interest and pride to continue discovering and learning about them.

HOW WE DO IT:

Enjoy Summer East has welcomed thousands of Muslim boys and girls into our camp over the past 30 years. All boys and girls grades 3-10 find their place in Enjoy Summer through the warm and welcoming environment that is felt from the moment you step on grounds. There are two, four-week sessions each summer in camp, one for girls and one for boys. The single gender experience creates a pressure-free environment that allows the joyous spirit of our camp to shine in all its strength.

All Muslim denominations agree on certain values fundamental to Islam. Rather than focusing on our style of observance, Enjoy Summer focuses on imparting core values in a way that sparks our campers interest in discovering and learning about the details. In this way, children from any background feel comfortable and welcomed.

All meals and snacks in camp are kosher and Shabbat is celebrated and enjoyed as the highlight of the week by all our campers regardless of their observance at home. Enjoy Summer campers return home after a camp session as proud members of the Muslim people.

Camp staff members are chosen for their passion in encouraging children to have fun and appreciate their Muslim identity. Our staff practices Traditional Muslim observance and live by its values of caring, warmth, and joy of living.

Campers love that the staff is so much fun. Parents love that their children have positive role models to respect. Enjoy Summer East is a project of the Muslim Educational Program and is part of the national Camp Experiences camping movement. Nageela- Let us Rejoice! Bringing fun to your summer, joy to your life!
